#  Introduction

Hi! I'm Tan Jia Xuan, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course. 
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.
- **Fun fact**: I love playing the guitar in my free time.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in maintaining and evolving software.
